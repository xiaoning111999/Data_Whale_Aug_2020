    "\n",
    "List markers typically start at the left margin, but may be indented by up to three spaces. List markers must be followed by one or more spaces or a tab. To make lists look nice, you can wrap items with hanging indents, but if you want to be lazy, you don’t have to.\n",
    "\n",

    "## 4. CODE BLOCKS\n",
    "\n",
    "Pre-formatted code blocks are used for writing about programming or markup source code. Rather than forming normal paragraphs, the lines of a code block are interpreted literally. Markdown wraps a code block in both <pre> and <code> tags.\n",
    "\n",
    "To produce a code block in Markdown, simply indent every line of the block by at least 4 spaces or 1 tab. For example, given this input:\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a normal paragraph:\n",
    "\n",
    "    This is a code block.\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown will generate:\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>This is a normal paragraph:</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre><code>This is a code block.\n",
    "</code></pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "One level of indentation — 4 spaces or 1 tab — is removed from each line of the code block. For example, this:\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of AppleScript:\n",
    "\n",
    "    tell application \"Foo\"\n",
    "        beep\n",
    "    end tell\n",
    "\n",
    "will turn into:\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Here is an example of AppleScript:</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre><code>tell application \"Foo\"\n",
    "    beep\n",
    "end tell\n",
    "</code></pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "A code block continues until it reaches a line that is not indented (or the end of the article).\n",
    "\n",
    "Within a code block, ampersands (&) and angle brackets (< and >) are automatically converted into HTML entities. This makes it very easy to include example HTML source code using Markdown — just paste it and indent it, and Markdown will handle the hassle of encoding the ampersands and angle brackets. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    <div class=\"footer\">\n",
    "        &copy; 2004 Foo Corporation\n",
    "    </div>\n",

    "    &amp;copy; 2004 Foo Corporation\n",
    "&lt;/div&gt;\n",
    "</code></pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular Markdown syntax is not processed within code blocks. E.g., asterisks are just literal asterisks within a code block. This means it’s also easy to use Markdown to write about Markdown’s own syntax.\n",

    "\n",
    "## 5. HORIZONTAL RULES\n",
    "You can produce a horizontal rule tag (<hr />) by placing three or more hyphens, asterisks, or underscores on a line by themselves. If you wish, you may use spaces between the hyphens or asterisks. Each of the following lines will produce a horizontal rule:\n",

    "\n",

    "The implicit link name shortcut allows you to omit the name of the link, in which case the link text itself is used as the name. Just use an empty set of square brackets — e.g., to link the word “Google” to the google.com web site, you could simply write:\n",

Compare the above examples: using reference-style links, the paragraph itself is only 81 characters long; with inline-style links, it’s 176 characters; and as raw HTML, it’s 234 characters. In the raw HTML, there’s more markup than there is text.\n",
    "\n",
    "With Markdown’s reference-style links, a source document much more closely resembles the final output, as rendered in a browser. By allowing you to move the markup-related metadata out of the paragraph, you can add links without interrupting the narrative flow of your prose."
